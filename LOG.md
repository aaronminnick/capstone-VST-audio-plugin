### Research & Planning Log
#### 2/18/22
0800 - 1000: Read through language documentation and tutorials on [C++](www.cplusplus.com) while writing small programs in Visual Studio to test my learning.

1030 - 1050: Prepared [README.md](./README.md) and [capstone-proposal.md](./capstone-proposal.md)

1050 - 1200: Continued with documentation and tutorials on [C++](www.cplusplus.com).

1520 - 1550: Reviewed some example plugin source code for [iPlug2 library](https://iplug2.github.io/) to see how well I could decipher it with some understanding of C++. Read the [iPlug2 whitepaper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/master/Documentation/Papers/WAC2018.pdf) which gives a high-level view of the library's capabilities.

1600 - 1645: Worked through [getting started tutorial](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/wiki/02_Getting_started_windows) for iPlug2. Succesfully opened example project in Visual Studio and built standalone and VST3 plugins from the example project.

1645 - 1700: Explored various examples included in plugin repo to try to get a grasp on general structure of a plugin and some of the parameters used.

##### Cumulative Hours 2/18: 5:00

#### 2/20/22
1300 - 1415: Read about digital sound processing (DSP) techniques and filter design from [Computer Music](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Music-Synthesis-Composition-Performance/dp/0028646827), one of my college textbooks, to refresh my memory on some concepts.

1415 - 1505: Worked through example plugin project and referenced against [iPlug2 documentation](https://iplug2.github.io/iPlug2/index.html) to better understand how parts of the solution are connected to eachother to process signal flow.

1900 - 2000: Creative exploration / analyzed and "broke down" the parameters of physical guitar pedals and listening to effected sound samples to think about possible ways to recreate the effects in a digital plugin.

##### Cumulative Hours 2/20: 3:05

#### 2/25/22
0910 - 1135: Finished reading through the tutorials / language introduction on [C++](www.cplusplus.com).

1215 - 1330: There are no tutorial series I can find for iPlug2, so I worked through the [tutorials for the original iPlug library by Martin Finke](http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/tags/making_audio_plugins.html). This was time consuming - there are a lot of differences in the basic structure of a plugin between versions.
* 1315: Got simple digital distortion to work.

1600 - 1715: Continue working through tutorials. Trying to add an oscillator but version differences in file structure make it confusing.

##### Cumulative Hours 2/25: 4:55

#### 2/28/22
1240 - 1310: Worked through installation and [getting started tutorial](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_new_projucer_project.html) for [JUCE](https://juce.com/), an alternate C++ audio plugin framework.

##### Cumulative Hours 2/28: 0:30

#### Cumulative Hours Total: 13:30
