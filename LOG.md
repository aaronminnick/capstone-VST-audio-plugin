#### 2/18/22
0800 - 1000: Read through language documentation and tutorials on [C++](www.cplusplus.com) while writing small programs in Visual Studio to test my learning.

1030 - 1050: Prepared [README.md](./README.md) and [capstone-proposal.md](./capstone-proposal.md)

1050 - 1200: Continued with documentation and tutorials on [C++](www.cplusplus.com).

1520 - 1550: Reviewed some example plugin source code for [iPlug2 library](https://iplug2.github.io/) to see how well I could decipher it with some understanding of C++. Read the [iPlug2 whitepaper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/master/Documentation/Papers/WAC2018.pdf) which gives a high-level view of the library's capabilities.
